** stringi package NEWS and CHANGELOG **
========================================

* 0.2-1 (XXXX-XX-XX)

   * [IMPORTANT CHANGE] stri_sort now does not include NAs
     in output vectors by default, for compatibility with sort(). Moreover, none
     of an input vector's attributes are preserved.

   * [NEW FEATURE] stri_order and stri_sort now have an additional argument
        `na_last` (defaults to TRUE and NA, respectively).

   * [NEW FEATURE] New functions and binary operators for string comparison:
       stri_cmp_eq, stri_cmp_neq, stri_cmp_lt, stri_cmp_le, stri_cmp_gt,
       stri_cmp_ge, %==%, %!=%, %<%, %<=%, %>%, %>=%.

   * [NEW FEATURE] stri_enc_toutf8 now has a new `validate` arg (defaults
     to FALSE for backward-compatibility). It may be used in a (rare) case
     in which a user wants to fix an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence.
     stri_length (among others) now detect invalid UTF-8 byte sequences.

   * [NEW FEATURE] stri_enc_tonative(str) is an alias to
     stri_encode(str, NULL, NULL).

   * [NEW FEATURE] stri_replace_na replaces NAs in a character vector
      with a given string, useful for emulating R's paste() behavior.

   * t.b.d.

   * [NEW FEATURE] stri_enc_mark - reads declared encodings of character strings
        as seen by stringi.

   * Performance improvements in StriContainerUTF8 and StriContainerUTF16
        (they affect most other functions).

   * Significant performance improvements in stri_join, stri_flatten,
        stri_cmp, stri_trans_to*, ...t.b.d....

   * Added 3rd mirror site for icudt.

   * U_MISSING_RESOURCE_ERROR message in StriException now suggests
        calling stri_install_check().

   * [BUGFIX] UTF-8 BOMs are now silently removed from input strings.

   * [BUGFIX] no more attempts to re-encode UTF-8 encoded strings
     if native encoding=UTF-8 in StriContainerUTF8.

   * [BUGFIX] possible memory leaks when throwing errors via Rf_error.

   * [BUGFIX] stri_order and stri_cmp could return incorrect results
       for opts_collator=NA.

   * [BUGFIX] stri_sort did not guarantee to return strings in UTF-8.


* 0.1-25 (2014-03-12)

    * LICENCE tweaks.

    * Initial CRAN release.


* 0.1-24 (2014-03-11)

    * Fixed bugs detected with ASan and UBSan,
      e.g. fixed CharClass::gcmask type (enum -> uint32_t) (reported by UBSan).

    * Fixed array over-runs detected with valgrind in string8.h.

    * Fixed unitialized class fields in StriContainerUTF8
      (reported by valgrind).


* 0.1-23 (2014-03-11)

    * License changed to BSD-3-clause, COPYRIGHTS updated.

    * icudt is not shipped with stringi anymore;
      it is now downloaded in install.libs.R from one of our servers.

    * New functions: stri_install_check(), stri_install_icudt().


* 0.1-22 (2014-02-20)

   * System ICU is used on systems which do have one (version >= 50 needed).
     ICU is autodetected with pkg-config in ./configure.
     Pass '--disable-pkg-config' to ./configure to force building ICU from
     sources.
   
   * icudt52b (custom subset) is now shipped with stringi
     (for big-endian, ASCII systems).


* 0.1-21 (2014-02-19)

   * Fixed some Solaris-related issues while preparing stringi
     for CRAN submission.


* 0.1-20 (2014-02-17)

   * ICU4C 52.1 sources included (common, i18n, stubdata + icu52dt.dat
     loaded dynamically). Compilation via Makevars.
   
   * stringi now does not depend on any external libraries.


* 0.1-11 (2013-11-16)

   * ICU4C is now statically linked on Windows.

   * First OS X binary build.
   
   * The package is being intensively tested by our students @ FMIS WUT.


* 0.1-10 (2013-11-13)
   
   * Using pkg-config via ./configure to look for ICU4C libs.


* 0.1-6 (2013-07-05)

   * First Windows binary build.
   
   * Compilation passed on Oracle Sun Studio compiler collection.
   
   * By now we have implemented most of the functionality
     scheduled for milestone 0.1.


* 0.1-1 (2013-01-05)
   *  The stringi project has been established on GitHub.
