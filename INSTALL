The stringi package depends on the ICU4C >= 52 library.
If you build the package from sources and either:

* these requirements are not met (check out http://site.icu-project.org/download
   or e.g. the `libicu-devel` rpm package on Fedora or `libicu-dev` on Ubuntu),

* `pkg-config` is not able to find proper build settings for ICU-based projects,
or

* R CMD INSTALL is called with `--configure-args='--disable-pkg-config'`,

then the library will be built together with stringi
(a custom subset of ICU4C 52.1 is shipped with the package).
By default, the ICU data library will be downloaded from one of our mirror servers.
However, if you have already downloaded a version of `icudt*.zip`
suitable for your platform (big/little endian), you may wish to install
the package by calling:

    install.packages("stringi", configure.vars="ICUDT_DIR=<dir_to_copy_icudt_from>")

You are encouraged to check whether the ICU data library (`icudt`)
has been successfully installed by calling:

    library('stringi')
    stri_install_check()

This is also to ensure that ICU has detected your locale and native
encoding properly.

Also do note that by default we require C++11 support to build the package
from sources. This is because ICU4C uses the `long long` type in a few
functions, and this is not part of the C++98 standard. Yet, if your compiler
does not support C++11 but you are sure it tolerates the `long long` type
(which is very common -- this will be checked by the `configure` script anyway),
you may disable the C++11 usage by passing the `--disable-cxx11` flag to
the `configure` script.
