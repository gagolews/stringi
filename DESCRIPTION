Title: Character String Processing Facilities
Description: Allows for fast, correct, consistent, portable,
    as well as convenient character string/text processing in every locale
    and any native encoding. Owing to the use of the ICU library,
    the package provides R users with platform-independent functions
    known to Java, Perl, Python, PHP, and Ruby programmers.
    Among available features there are: pattern searching
    (e.g. via regular expressions), random string generation,
    string collation, transliteration, concatenation,
    date-time formatting and parsing, etc.
