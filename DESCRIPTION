Title: Fast and Portable Character String Processing Facilities
Description: A collection of character string/text/natural language
    processing tools for pattern searching (e.g., with 'Java'-like regular
    expressions or the 'Unicode' collation algorithm), random string generation,
    case mapping, string transliteration, concatenation, sorting, padding,
    wrapping, Unicode normalisation, date-time formatting and parsing,
    and many more. They are fast, consistent, convenient, and -
    thanks to 'ICU' (International Components for Unicode) -
    portable across all locales and platforms. Documentation about 'stringi' is
    provided via its website at <https://stringi.gagolewski.com/> and
    the paper by Gagolewski (2022, <doi:10.18637/jss.v103.i02>).
