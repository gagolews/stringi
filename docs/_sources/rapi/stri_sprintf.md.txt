# stri\_sprintf: Format Strings

## Description

A Unicode-aware replacement for the built-in [`sprintf`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/sprintf.html) function. Moreover, `stri_printf` prints formatted strings.

## Usage

```r
stri_sprintf(
  format,
  ...,
  na_string = NA_character_,
  inf_string = "Inf",
  nan_string = "NaN",
  use_length = FALSE
)

stri_string_format(
  format,
  ...,
  na_string = NA_character_,
  inf_string = "Inf",
  nan_string = "NaN",
  use_length = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

## Details

Vectorized over `format` and all vectors passed via `...`.

`stri_string_format` is a synonym for `stri_sprintf`.

Note that `stri_printf` treats missing values in `...` as `"NA"` strings by default.

Note that Unicode code points may have various widths when printed on the console and that, by default, the function takes that into account. By changing the state of the `use_length` argument, this function act as if each code point was of width 1.

For `%d` and `%f` formats, factors are treated as integer vectors (underlying codes) and so are date and time objects, etc.

This function is not locale sensitive. For instance, numbers are always formatted in the \"POSIX\" style, e.g., `-123456.789`. Such a feature might be added at a later date, though.

All arguments passed via `...` are evaluated. If some of them are unused, a warning is generated. Too few arguments result in an error.

## Value

`stri_printf` is used for its side effect, which is printing text on the standard output or other connection/file. Hence, it returns `invisible(NULL)`.

The other functions return a character vector.

## Examples




```r
#...
#stri_printf("%4s=%.3f", c("e", "e\u00b2", "\u03c0", "\u03c0\u00b2"),
#    c(exp(1), exp(2), pi, pi^2))

# vectorization wrt all arguments:
#p <- runif(10)
#stri_sprintf(ifelse(p > 0.5, "P(Y=1)=%1$.2f", "P(Y=0)=%2$.2f"), p, 1-p)

# using a "preformatted" logical vector:
#x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, NA, TRUE, FALSE)
#stri_sprintf("%s) %s", letters[seq_along(x)], c("\u2718", "\u2713")[x+1])
```
